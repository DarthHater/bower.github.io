<p class="lead">Web sites are made of lots of things â€” frameworks, libraries, assets, and utilities. Bower manages all these things for you.</p>

Keeping track of all these packages and making sure they are up to date (or set to the specific versions you need) is trick. Bower to the rescue!

Bower isn't limited to JavaScript libraries and can manage any front-end components, including CSS (e.g. Bootstrap), HTML or static assets like images. Bower doesn't concatenate or minify code or do anything else. All Bower does is install the right versions of the packages you need and their dependencies. It's completely dedicated to managing your packages.

To [get started](#getting-started), Bower works by fetching and installing [packages](/search) from all over, taking care of hunting, finding, downloading, and saving the stuff you're looking for. Bower keeps track of these packages in a manifest file, [`bower.json`](/docs/creating-packages/#bowerjson). How you use [packages](/search) is up to you. Bower provides hooks to facilitate using packages in your [tools and workflows](/docs/tools).

Bower is optimized for the front-end. It will install packages only once (e.g. JQuery would always be in 
`bower_components/jquery`, no matter how many packages depend on it). In the case of a conflict, Bower just won't install the package that conflicts with what's already installed. This helps reduce page load to a minimum.

## Install Bower

Bower is a command line utility. Install it globally with npm.

{% highlight bash %}
$ npm install -g bower
{% endhighlight %}

Bower requires [node, npm](http://nodejs.org/) and [git](http://git-scm.org).

Latest release: [**v1.6.8**](https://github.com/bower/bower/releases/tag/v1.6.8)

For troubleshooting installation on different platforms, read the [troubleshooting](https://github.com/bower/bower/wiki/Troubleshooting) wiki page.

## Getting started

### Install packages

Install packages with [`bower install`](/docs/api#install). Bower installs packages to `bower_components/`.

{% highlight bash %}
$ bower install <package>
{% endhighlight %}

A package can be a GitHub shorthand, a Git endpoint, a URL, and more. Read more about [`bower install`](/docs/api/#install).

{% highlight bash %}
# registered package
$ bower install jquery
# GitHub shorthand
$ bower install desandro/masonry
# Git endpoint
$ bower install git://github.com/user/package.git
# URL
$ bower install http://example.com/script.js
{% endhighlight %}

### Search packages

[Search Bower packages](http://bower.io/search) and find the registered package names for your favorite projects.

### Save packages

Save your packages to [`bower.json` with `bower init`](/docs/creating-packages/#bowerjson).

### Use packages

How you use packages is up to you. We recommend you use Bower together with [Grunt, RequireJS, Yeoman, and lots of other tools](/docs/tools/) or build your own workflow with [the API](/docs/api/). You can also use the installed packages directly, like this, in the case of `jquery`:

{% highlight html %}
<script src="bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"></script>
{% endhighlight %}
